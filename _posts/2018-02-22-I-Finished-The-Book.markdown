# Finishing the Book: _Turning Pro_

It's sad to finish this book, as it is with any book that you truly connect with.  This book connected even more deeply to me than _Doing The Work_.  I think it hit me between the eyes about identifying _that one thing_: making up your mind.  Deciding.  Deciding to do what you have always known you need to do.

Perhaps what helped me connect with this book was that Pressfield happened to call out my particular favorites for _Resistance_.  I've always had my particular gifts that I know I can give to the world.  But, instead, I keep them to myself.  And largely, the way I accomplish this fear-based indecision is by telling myself that my gifts aren't really that special.  Or certainly no one's gonna die because _I_ don't follow my passion and commit to my art.  

But everything else Pressfield says about what happens to an individual who remains wishy washy in their commitment has happened to me.  Mainly, he or she just doesn't love their life anymore.  They just fall out of love with life in general.  If you're not _living out lout_ then you're not really living at all.  I think this describes me, unfortunately.

# You Never Really Finish This Book

I'm keeping a copy of this book close by my workspace.  Or workspaces.  I'm keeping a browser tab tuned to my kindle copy of this book.  I think this book is like scripture, where each day you can read a few verses and remind yourself of how to care for your inner artist.  I need to touch my soul every single day.  

_The War of Art_ is already at one of two of my workspaces.  I think this is a terrific book as well.  It's also one of those books that is like scripture.  You should probably read a few verses each day.  These stories and parable should probably committed to one's heart.  I think that's how I regard these books--I will treat _Turning Pro_ like another book of scripture.  A book that is so good and so valuable, you can actually memorize certain passages and quote them to yourself when you need inspiration and insight.
