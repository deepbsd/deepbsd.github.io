## Manjaro Linux i3wm Edition

I recently got a hankering to use my terminal more.  I guess I've been afraid
that I may have gone soft using so many graphical applications.  All that effort
I put into learning keyboard shortcuts and command sequences may have gone away
a little bit from disuse.  Well, I don't want that to happen!  So I'm going back
to what I've been good at.

# i3wm

I've already written about this window manager a little bit.  But one of the
recent tendencies in the Linux world is to make distributions around a single
desktop environment, such as "XFCE Edition" or "KDE Edition" or whatever.  In a
way this makes sense, because each of those environments takes up quite a bit of
space.  If you know you want Gnome, why would you want KDE installed?  Good
question.  With a tiling window manager, there are very few dependencies.  So it
makes sense to create an edition that is so lightweight as i3.  That's what
Manjaro has done

I'll add more to this post later.  Right now, it's time to get my repo.
