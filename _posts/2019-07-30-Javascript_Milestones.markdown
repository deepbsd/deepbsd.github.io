## Milestones in the Javascript Journey

It dawned on me as I woke up this morning that there seem to be several common "ah ha!" moments among
Javascript developers. For example, when you write your first Promise, that's one of them.  You're
first learning about asynchronous programming and how milliseconds matter.  When you first use `call()` or 
`apply()`, you might begin to wonder about an execution context.  Or even when you first try to write a
closure or an IIFE, that would probably be one of those "ah ha!" moments.

I thought it might be interesting to identify as many of those moments as I could from my own journey
as a JS developer.

# The Moment When JS First Seems Cool!

I first looked at Javascript in the 90's, and I thought it was a toy language.  I think a lot of
people thought that.  But then eventually, something happened.  Smart people started using it and did
interesting things on the web.  And then more smart people started using it, and pretty soon, lots of
Javascript's problems starting getting fixed or improved.  It took a while, but JS no longer was a toy
language.  In fact, if you said it was, it was you who were not cool.  Javascript was cool all on its
own.  

From my own Journey, I guess I'm a slow learner, because I thought it was dumb for a long time.  And
then I started using `call()` or `apply()` or `bind()` to pass execution contexts between functions.  I learned how
React passes these contexts and far more within the application, and it's subtle and clever.
Somewhere along the way, I stopped saying "Why can't I work in Python instead?"  Javascript seemed
cool all on its own.  My perspective changed.

At another time, I decided to read the jQuery library as though it were a short story.  That was a
funny experience, because although I could understand all the words and symbols, I couldn't understand
the meaning right away.  It was sort of like reading a Lewis Carrol book.  You think it's a fairy
tale, but it's not.  It just looks that way.  So it was for me and Javascript.  I started waking up to
the hidden beauty and meanings.
