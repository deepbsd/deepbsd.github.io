# The New Box

Well, it's together but it's not running yet.  I still need a mini-HDMI to HDMI adapter.  And some speakers.  I'm fresh out of speakers.  Once I get those two things, I should be able to install an OS on this box.  

This new box doesn't have a name yet.  I'm pretty sure I'm going to install Solus OS on it, with a Budgie desktop.  I've heard wonderful things about the Linux distro as well as the desktop, so I'm eager to find out for myself.

# The KVM

The KVM works well.  I have three boxes hooked up to it right now, and the new box will be number 4.  The third box is a Hackintosh, and for some reason, it has trouble identifying the mouse when I switch back to the box.  The keyboard and mouse are immediately available on the rest of the boxes, but there's something about the USB detection on that Hackintosh that makes me have to unplug and replug in my USB mouse into the KVM.  

I'm not sure whether I'll be able to use the keyboard shortcuts designed for the KVM.  They appear to be using the 10-key number pad.  My keyboard is a 10-keyless Masterkeys Pro S from Cooler Master.  It's a terrific keyboard.  But I'm not sure I can use it to change computers.  No matter.  The buttons work great.

# My Pomodoros

I'm back on track.  I got my double sets today, so that was 4 solid hours of programming.  But I hit a wall.  I need to make some rather big changes to my API, and I'm not sure how to do it.  It's gonna take some more research and probably some advice from Thinkful Gurus.

But _Resistance_ came back today.  I've been feeling it alot.  But at times like this, I simply have to remember who I am and what I want.
