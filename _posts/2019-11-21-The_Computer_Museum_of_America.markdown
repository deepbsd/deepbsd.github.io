##  Computer Museum in Georgia

I was truly surprised at how awesome this museum is.  It's a fairly new museum, less than
three years old, and yet it has a massive collection of not just personal machines, but
also super computers and mainframe computers.  There's also a collection of early DEC
computers, such as the PDP-8 and others, that really bring back memories.  Those were
computers that I had always heard about but had never seen up close.  Those were
computers the elite hackers used and worked on.  In fact, I believe it was a PDP-7 that
Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson wrote UNIX on mostly.  Then later they ported it to the
new PDP-11 at Bell labs.  Later they rewrote Unix in the new C language.
