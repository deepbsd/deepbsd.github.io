So this is my first blog entry on the local Jekyll server.  I've got line wrap enabled, so I don't know how that will workout.  Not sure if line wrap is supposed to be turned off.  No idea.  I guess I'll find out!

I just installed Ruby 2.4 and Jekyll on Pumpkin here.  Pumpkin runs OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, the latest and greatest.  I'm listening to Spotify in the background.  I'm typing on a Cooler Master 87-key small keyboard.  It's 10-keyless and fits in the space I have very nicely.  What I love is the Cherry MX Blue keys.  Just the right amount of feedback and resistence.  

I'm using a recent (the latest I think) version of Sublime Text.  Of course, it recognizes markdown language right away.  Very smart editor.  

Question: how do I import pictures here?  I'm not very fluent in markdown.  It can't be very difficult; there's got to be a cheatsheet around somewhere.  

I can see this is going to take some practice!  That's fine.
