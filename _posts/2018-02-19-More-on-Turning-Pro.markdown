# More on Turning Pro

It's becoming clearer to me how I am resisting my higher Self.  Something inside wants to grow and share the insights as Life hands them to me.  Yet I resist out of fear of disappointing other people, I suppose.  I fear rejection by my tribe I guess.  The irony is that I don't really join tribes.  Even if I had a tribe, I typically quit the tribe before I ever get a chance to disappoint them.  And what I avoid most is making a decision about who I am and what I do in life.  I fear that if I make this definition of my self, it will be a mistake, and something awful will happen.  

I'm not sure what this awful thing could possibly be.  I guess the worst is being tortured and killed or something.  And somehow making up my mind about who I am and what I do is supposed to lead to this.  So I remain undecided.  I remain a dilettante.  I remain an amateur.  

This is where the change needs to happen.  I need to realize that my Tribe doesn't give a shit about what I do with my life.  If either of us pisses the other off, we can simply part ways.  This has happened a lot in my life.  It has never lead to bloodshed in my case.  Even if it could, I typically believe in being well armed.  So holding off on defining what my life is about makes no sense.

## Defining a Self

I believe in on-going course correction.  It's what professionals do every day.  So no self-definition needs to stay cast in granite.  I can auto-correct as I go.  

At this point, I see myself as a wise man, a prophet of sorts, in very small letters.  But I seem to have a gift in applying the vision of the higher self to the mundane life.  I seem to notice human blind spots.  I find myself fascinated by shadow material, both my own and that of my fellow human beings.

I also am a geek.  I'm a technical guy--a programmer.  I build computers and make them do interesting and productive things.  

Further, I'm a journeyman in written language.  Err, at least I was supposed to be by now.  This is the One Thing I have resisted most in my life I think.  This is One Gift that was stronger and apparent when I was younger, but I have not nurtured it.  It's what I have run away from.  

Ironically, again, there are a hundred or more shadow versions of this ambition I have pursued in life.  My first career was as a technical writer.  Not a bad choice.  But my commitment to writing as art slid into ocean like a melted glacier.  

And yet, here I am writing in a blog.  Another blog.  I can see now that even this is connected to my aspiration to be a writer.  I cannot even neglect this aspiration to blog unless I'm willing to suffer the consequences of ignoring my higher calling.  If I resist, the pain persists.

So I am a writer-programmer-philosopher.  That's me.  I'm a WPP.
