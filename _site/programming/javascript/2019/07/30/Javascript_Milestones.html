    <h2 id="milestones-in-the-javascript-journey">Milestones in the Javascript Journey</h2>

<p>It dawned on me as I woke up this morning that there seem to be several common “ah ha!” moments among
Javascript developers. For example, when you write your first Promise, that’s one of them.  You’re
first learning about asynchronous programming and how milliseconds matter.  When you first use <code class="highlighter-rouge">call()</code> or 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">apply()</code>, you might begin to wonder about an execution context.  Or even when you first try to write a
closure or an IIFE, that would probably be one of those “ah ha!” moments.</p>

<p>I thought it might be interesting to identify as many of those moments as I could from my own journey
as a JS developer.</p>

<h1 id="the-moment-when-js-first-seems-cool">The Moment When JS First Seems Cool!</h1>

<p>I first looked at Javascript in the 90’s, and I thought it was a toy language.  I think a lot of
people thought that.  But then eventually, something happened.  Smart people started using it and did
interesting things on the web.  And then more smart people started using it, and pretty soon, lots of
Javascript’s problems starting getting fixed or improved.  It took a while, but JS no longer was a toy
language.  In fact, if you said it was, it was you who were not cool.  Javascript was cool all on its
own.</p>

<p>From my own Journey, I guess I’m a slow learner, because I thought it was dumb for a long time.  And
then I started using <code class="highlighter-rouge">call()</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">apply()</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">bind()</code> to pass execution contexts between functions.  I learned how
React passes these contexts and far more within the application, and it’s subtle and clever.
Somewhere along the way, I stopped saying “Why can’t I work in Python instead?”  Javascript seemed
cool all on its own.  My perspective changed.</p>

<p>At another time, I decided to read the jQuery library as though it were a short story.  That was a
funny experience, because although I could understand all the words and symbols, I couldn’t understand
the meaning right away.  It was sort of like reading a Lewis Carrol book.  You think it’s a fairy
tale, but it’s not.  It just looks that way.  So it was for me and Javascript.  I started waking up to
the hidden beauty and meanings.</p>

<h1 id="each-language-has-a-vibe">Each Language Has a Vibe</h1>

<p>I use several languages regularly now: JS, python, bash and some ruby.  I consider JS and Node the
same language with different toolboxes.  But I would consider using python to be like driving a
Cadillac or perhaps a BMW SUV type of vibe.  Everything you ever wanted at your fingertips is right
there, and there are plenty of extra buttons you never thought you needed or even heard of.  But
they’re right there.  It’s extremely easy to to express your thoughts and can do it without exerting
yourself.</p>

<p>Ruby is sort of like driving a Lexus or something.  Lots and lots of convenience and economy and good
sense.  Occasionally you come upon something that doesn’t make sense.  You scratch your head, but
there’re are ten other ways of doing what you want, so you just move on with a small question
lingering in your head.  I would say the Ruby Lexus has buttons that leave you with that feeling.</p>

<p>Bash and its predicessors have lots of weird symbols and unique attributes, sort of like a Willies
Jeep in 1944.  Back then, the Jeep was the only thing you had available that would carve through war
torn Europe where paved roads no longer existed.  Likewise, Bash is clumsy in some ways, but aside
from Perl and Python, Bash (and other shell languages) are the most direct way to talk to UNIX
filesystems and handle I/O from other UNIX utilities.  But there are a lot of weird syntax oddities.</p>

<p>JS/Node is unlike any of those.  It strikes me like a French Citroen or something that I would not
like at first, because it looks really weird, but once you start driving it around, you wonder where
it’s been all your life.  I’ve never driven a Citroen, but who knows?  I might get that feeling if I
started driving one a lot?</p>

<p>JS/Node is kind of alluring, because being skillful with it can get you a job.  Those skills are in
demand.  Also, there are shortcuts available that make it appear sexy, such as ASI and bracket
shortcuts and functions with rocketship operators.  There are ways of making it terse once you become
fluent in it.  You can eventually say a lot by writing a little, just as in Python and Ruby.</p>

<p>But the real power of JS/Node is in the functional capabilities.  IIFE’s, closures, <code class="highlighter-rouge">call()</code> and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">apply()</code>–those are the gateway to the majesty of the language.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Using JS/Node is like driving some kind of exotic car (or vehicle) that looks weird but has unusual
and powerful technology (like, a warpdrive or something).  But you have to use it for a while before
you can find the right buttons to push to make it work.  And it still looks weird.  There’s probably
nothing to be done for that.</p>
